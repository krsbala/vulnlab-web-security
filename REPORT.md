## Mini Project – Web Penetration Testing

### Objective
To identify and exploit common web application vulnerabilities using industry-standard penetration testing tools.

### Tools and Techniques
- Footprinting: Nmap, Nikto, Dirb
- Authentication Attacks: Burp Suite, Hydra
- Injection Attacks: SQLmap, XSSer
- Command Injection: Manual exploitation

### Result
Multiple vulnerabilities were successfully identified and exploited, demonstrating insecure authentication mechanisms and improper input validation.

### Conclusion
The project highlights the importance of secure coding practices and layered defense mechanisms in web applications.
